## Introduction

As we get busier and busier, we have less time to decide if things are good.  We are building a simple neural network utilizing a bag-of-words model to create the necessary features.  The neural network will use each word as features, while each row is a separate sentence to predict movie review star ratings.

## Goal

To predict the star ratings (0 - 5) of a review.

## Data
Amazon product data obtained from [here](jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon).  The data used was reviews from Amazon Instand Video, which contained information such as `reviewerID`, `asin`, `reviewerName` and others, but for the sake of this project we are focusing mainly on:
* `reviewText`: Sentence-form review of the video. 
* `overall`: Rating of the review in integer star format.
